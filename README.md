 <li>Simulate the Producer Consumer code discussed in the class.</li>

 <li>Extend the producer consumer simulation in Q1 to sync access of critical data using Petersons algorithm.</li>

 <li><strong>Dictionary Problem:</strong> Let the producer set up a dictionary of at least 20 words with three attributes (Word, Primary meaning, Secondary meaning) and let the consumer search for the word and retrieve its respective primary and secondary meaning.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Note:</strong> This can be implemented using either Mutex locks or Petersons algorithm.

<strong><u>Non-Mandatory (Extra credits):</u> </strong>

<ol start="4">

 <li>Extend Q3 to avoid duplication of dictionary entries and implement an efficient binary search on the consumer side in a multithreaded fashion.</li>

 <li>Trace and understand the working of synchronization algorithms like Dijkstra, Dekkerâ€™s algorithm</li>
